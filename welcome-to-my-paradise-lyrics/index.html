<p>Welcome to my paradise
come and take a look out through my eyes
and you decide why people act this way
people thieving, fighting, telling lies
they criticize and hate each other

all of. Released for the first time on cd. She'll be waiting in kingston town. Title (format)label cat# country year; She'll be waiting in kingston town,by now.</p>
